              Shopify is a complete commerce platform that lets you start, grow,
              and manage a business. With Shopify, you can:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-item">
              <li>Create and customize an online store</li>
              <li>
                Sell in multiple places, including web, mobile, social media,
                online marketplaces, brick-and-mortar locations, and pop-up
                shops
              </li>
              <li>Manage products, inventory, payments, and shipping</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Shopify is completely cloud-based and hosted, which means you
              don’t have to worry about upgrading or maintaining software or web
              servers. This gives you the flexibility to access and run your
              business from almost anywhere, including your mobile device.

              Yes, you can use your own domain name with Shopify. <br> If you have an
              existing domain name, you can connect it to Shopify from your
              store’s admin. <br> If you don’t have a domain name yet, you can either
              buy one through Shopify or a third-party provider.
